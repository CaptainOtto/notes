## Tips

### Track with active file
Helps a great deal when working with larger projects by actively syncing in the solution explorer what file you currently have open.

If you want to always track the open file simply go to: Tools>Options>Projects & Solutions

### Toolbox
Add reusable code into the toolbox such as code snippets you want to reuse throughout your code base. Access it through View>Toolbox. Add new elements simply by dragging them into the toolbox.

### File navigation and more
My preferred way of accessing files or searching is by two different ways:
- CTRL F, by ctrl f you gain access of searching through documents, projects or solution which is very handy for quick searches in the file for functions etc.

- CTRL T is something that i use quite alot I think it's called quick launch or so. Very useful for searching for files by pressing f in the search field then followed up by the filename. There are also other combinations you can use inside of this search bar such as T for type or search for members with ALT\ and more.

- Navigate to line by CTRL + G for navigating to a specific line in the said file.

- Navigate to functions by clicking here and selecting a specific function.

- CTRL + SHIFT + H for find and replace window for finding and replacing all of a occcurance.

### Vertical selection
You can also select vertically by holding alt whilst clicking around.

### Collapse all
Very useful trick when you have very large files and want to work on something specific is to first collapse all by pressing CTRL + M & O.

### Modify your navigational bar
Modify your navigational bar by removing and adding buttons that you rarely or frequenty use by simply clicking on the button shown here.

## Git
One maybe overlooked thing sometimes when working with source control and visual studio is using git inside the editor. Either can be done with the git window:

or a inside the editor powershell:

For git there are a couple of extensions named below that you can get and then access at the tab through the git tab or accessing the terminal through View>Terminal.
